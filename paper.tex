The field of cas - complex adaptive systems


For any theory about tangible phenemena to be developed or advanced, we need to have information about the system(s). We claim that, especially when dealing with the kind of chaotic and intericate systems that characterize cas, we cannot effectively iterate on a theory that attempts to predict the future state of a system unless we have a near-total understanding of the current state of the system. Since we are attempting to develop a theory, we will have to go through the process

Claim:
Good awareness of the state of the system
The ability to rapidly learn from predictions and iterate on the theory itself
The ability to poke the system in a specific way to test some particular component of the theory


As far as our best theories in meterology [2] and economics [3] fail (sometimes spectacularly) past the short term.
